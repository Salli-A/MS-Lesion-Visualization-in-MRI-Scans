The swi / phase seem to not be 100% registered to align. The SWI/pahse have different coordinate systems/orientation and when rotated and sliced it does not seem to match 100%.
-Could be due to size mismatch + slicing? maybe possible to create a function to inflate swi/phase to match?


Needs a way to change opacity/transfer function manually in the app - perhaps best to create a control panel and submission panel seperatly.
Control panel: 
    views (saggital, axial, coronal),
    modes: (volume slice, 2d slice, full volume),
    information on controls (shift+scroll = zoom, scroll = go though slices, etc.),
    transfer functions, 
    activate segmentations (automatic or premade masks?),
    

Needs an automatic intitial opacity - based on histogram? (pehaps could be good to do on per slice basis?)
