# Needs to be done:

- Change camera view with coronal/axial (look into findBounds and setSLiceDirection on slice_interactor.py)
- Fix rotations of swi and phase (not orientated in the same way as t1 and flair)
    - Applying userTransformations changes slicing plane rotation as well (causing a mix up between axial, coronal, sagittal between modalities - seen by putting true on swi_phase_modality in renderPlaneVolume),
     possible fixes:
        - Seperate handling of t1/flair and swi/phase with seperate volume renders and slice interactor functions?
        - Apply rotation/ change axis before inserting into rendering pipeline?
    - Make sure that the modalities are registered since the SWI/phase had different orientation?
- Fix color and opacity transfer functions for modalities
    - Seperate transfer functions for each modality
    - Automatic based on histogram? Adjustable (pehaps could be good to do on per slice basis?)?
- Needs animation (mayve the way the camera sync is done counts as an animation as it makes use of timers?)
- Add lesion segmentation mask
- Change step sice, not only slice thickness (seperate step size from setSliceThickness in slice_interactor.py)
- Create stero to [CrystalEyes] - double check in the slides which stereo rendering method (just needds to be added with SetStereoTypeToCrystalEyes() and perhaps adding parameters for distance from screen etc.)

Perhaps:
- Change basic control scheme from vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera to not allow for rotation, only zoom and paning.
    - vtkInteractorStyleImage? (should only need to change in the SLiceInteractor class in slicer_interactor.py)
    - Would need option to change "sides"

Bounds - Spatial coords
Extent - Object pixels

T1 Bounds: (0.0, 255.0, 0.0, 255.0, 0.0, 175.0)
T1 Extent: (0, 255, 0, 255, 0, 175)

FLAIR Bounds: (0.0, 249.51171875, 0.0, 249.51171875, 0.0, 190.80000758171082)
FLAIR Extent: (0, 511, 0, 511, 0, 159)

SWI Bounds: (0.0, 209.16666167974472, 0.0, 239.16666096448898, 0.0, 142.5)
SWI Extent: (0, 251, 0, 287, 0, 95)

PHASE Bounds: (0.0, 209.16666167974472, 0.0, 239.16666096448898, 0.0, 142.5)
PHASE Extent: (0, 251, 0, 287, 0, 95)

When I rotate the SWI/phase this is the transform code:

    transform = vtk.vtkTransform()
    transform.Translate(center_x, center_y, center_z)
    transform.RotateZ(-90)
    transform.RotateY(90)
    transform.Translate(-center_x, -center_y, -center_z)
    volume.SetUserTransform(transform)

In theory it should be

    transform = vtk.vtkTransform()
    transform.Translate(-center_x, -center_y, -center_z)
    transform.RotateZ(-90)
    transform.RotateY(90)
    transform.Translate(center_x, -center_y, center_z)
    volume.SetUserTransform(transform)

Where it move the object to the global center, rotates and moves it back. But it doesn't work and this works?
